## How to use
### Starting Games
Start with the basics of a discord bot (Getting the token, making the files, etc) then, in your main file put this
```js
const Discord = require('discord.js')
const minigames = require('discord-minigames')
const client = new Discord.client()

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log(`${client.tag} is online!`)
})

client.on('message', message => {
    let member = message.mentions.members.first()    
        if (message.content.startsWith() === "!battle" && member) {
            minigames.startBattle(member, message)
        } else if (message.content.startsWith() === "!ispy" && member) {
            minigames.startISpy(member, message)
        }
})
client.login('YOUR_TOKEN')
```
Now when a Discord member does `!<game name> [ mention ]` they will request a game with that person!
